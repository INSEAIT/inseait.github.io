                    <p><strong>What does Software Engineering means ? </strong></p>
                    <p>Software Engineering is the capability of analyzing needs and constructing and designing a
                        certain application
                        that provides these needs through the use of software programming languages. And as we know, a
                        user needs is always
                        in permanent state, so the software Engineering involves also the process of analyzing existing
                        software and
                        modifying it to meet the current needs, as a result the software engineer is also in permanent
                        work. His work
                        demands using the best practices and processes that should be applied in software development,
                        in other words,
                        there must be discipline and control during all the process. <br /> <br /> <strong>Why choose
                            Software Engineering
                            ? <br /> </strong><br /> The most important precondition is to love software engineering,
                        to have a passion for
                        it, to be eager to explore learn invent and create new applications. Also everyone has this
                        mistake of thinking
                        that a software engineer is just a programmer or a &laquo;coding-monkey&nbsp;&raquo; anybody
                        can do that, which
                        totally wrong, you should be a real engineer that knows not only how to code but to know so
                        many other aspects like
                        : analyze the needs, code both front-end and back-end &laquo;&nbsp;full stack&nbsp;&raquo;,
                        work with database,
                        with servers, write automated tests, think about the application architecture, the development
                        environment,
                        technologies and frameworks and the gesture method of the project ...etc. Furthermore, to be a
                        software engineer
                        you must certainly work professionally on many software projects with many people that can be
                        part of the
                        developing team or your superior or the product owner that can have no relation with
                        programming world, all does he
                        want is a final product that provides all his needs, so the point here is to learn how to
                        communicate with all
                        member of the team and sure to understand each one of them. Another important point for a
                        better software engineer
                        is to spend some private time with himself to learn permanently new stuff about all the new
                        technologies used in
                        this domain. <br /> <br /> So if you are able to do all this things you should be a software
                        engineer. Also,
                        software engineer is a smart career choice &ndash; it's one of the most in-demand skills in the
                        world.<br /> <br />

                        the newest frameworks
                        used in software ? <br /> <br /> <strong>Angular<br /> </strong><br /> AngularJS is an
                        open-source JavaScript
                        framework. Designed to build single-page applications. Its goal is to extend browser-based apps
                        based on the MVC
                        template, as well as simplify testing and development<br /> <br /> <strong>Django<br />
                        </strong><br /> Released in
                        2005, Django is a framework that is written in Python.Django follows the Model-View-Template
                        (MVT) architecture.
                        Generally, complex and data-driven websites are built using this framework. Just to give you an
                        idea, popular sites
                        like Instagram, Disqus, and NASA, have been built using Django.<br /> <br /> <strong>Laravel<br />
                        </strong><br />
                        Laravel is a free PHP general-purpose open source framework, which was born relatively recently
                        - in 2011, but
                        thanks to the rapid development today it is one of the most popular PHP engines, which can save
                        you from spaghetti
                        code. <br /> <br /> <strong>Spring <br /> </strong><br /> Spring is the most popular Java
                        Framework and is
                        extensively used in enterprise solutions. Most of the enterprise solutions which use Java are
                        Spring Framework
                        based. Java is also a popular choice in enterprise solutions.<br /> Spring and all its modules
                        including Spring
                        MVC, Spring Core, Spring Security, Spring ORM etc are used in enterprise applications. It is a
                        good choice for
                        building massive web based applications. <br /> <br /> <strong>Ruby on rails <br /> </strong><br />
                        Ruby on Rails,
                        or simply Rails, is a server-side framework that is written in Ruby (programming language).
                        It&rsquo;s associated
                        with Rapid Application Development (RAD), as it supports the reusability of code and
                        accommodates changes rather
                        easily.<br /> It has an extensive development community, owing to its open source nature. Rails
                        prefers conventions
                        to configuration. In other words, developers can use various conventions instead of configuring
                        files. This
                        significantly speeds up the development process.<br /> <br /> <strong>Symfony<br /> </strong><br />
                        Symphony is a
                        PHP framework that is quite rich in features. Two things which make it quite popular in the
                        developer community are
                        bundles and components.Another highlight of Symfony is its documentation, which is on par with
                        the best PHP
                        frameworks. It is very legible, well-structured, and supplemented with various eхamples.
                        Moreover, it is frequently
                        updated.<br /> <br /> <strong>How is Software Engineering in our Institute (INSEA) ? <br />
                        </strong><br /> The
                        formation in our Institute is known for the quality of the engineers graduated, this formation
                        provides for its
                        students a lot of knowledge that goes with current demands of the market and makes the graduated
                         software engineers able to confront We find concretely in our formation different modules like : project gesture
                        and quality methods,
                        Software Architecture, Java Recent Framworks like spring hibernate and others, ERP,
                        Urbanization of information
                        system, these are the essential fields that are programmed for the software engineers in our
                        Institute that make
                        them able to adapt in any job, and of course many other courses. As for the statistics in
                        Morocco confirm that the
                        software engineers from INSEA are permanently demanded. <br /> <br /> &nbsp;</p>
